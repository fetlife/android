### Installing the App on your Android Device

1. Enable installing application from unknwon sources.
For more information about how to do it please read the following [guideline](https://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/open-distribution.html#unknown-sources)

2. Download and install the [fetlife-1.7.18.apk](https://github.com/fetlife/android/releases/download/v1.7.18/fetlife-1.7.18.apk) to your device

If you would like to have less kinky icon and app name to make the app look like a usual app on your device, you can rather download our vanilla version [fetlife-vanilla-1.7.18.apk](https://github.com/fetlife/android/releases/download/v1.7.18/fetlife-vanilla-1.7.18.apk)

3. (Optional) disable application install from unknown sources.

### Kinksters Helping Kinksters

Want to install the app on your phone but are not technically savvy? Ask your local kinky geek! Technically savvy and want to give back to the community... bring your laptop with you the next time you attend an event and install / update the app for anyone who's interested in having it install on their phone. *#KinkstersHelpingKinksters*
